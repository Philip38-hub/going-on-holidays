# 📌 Paper Prototype & Wireframe Exercise

## 🚀 Overview
This exercise involves creating a **paper prototype** (low-fidelity) and **wireframe** (mid-fidelity) for our traveler solution. The goal is to visualize the user flow and refine it based on usability testing.

## 📂 Deliverables

1. **Pictures of the paper prototype** (6 to 12 screens max).
2. **A Figma file** with mid-fidelity wireframes (black and white, main elements only).
3. **Usability testing guide** based on the Design Sprint Five-Act Interview.
4. **All files uploaded to GitHub** in a zip folder named:
   - `ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName`
   - Example: `TravelEase_Doe_John_Prototype_05242024_V1`

## 🛠️ Steps

### 1️⃣ Create a Paper Prototype
- Sketch **6 to 12 mobile frames** on paper.
- Each frame represents **one main screen** of the app.
- Focus on **layout and navigation** (no micro-interactions).
- Take **clear pictures** of the sketches.

### 2️⃣ Usability Testing
- Prepare a **usability testing guide** (based on Design Sprint Five-Act Interview).
- Conduct tests with **three participants**.
- Gather **feedback** on navigation, clarity, and usability.

### 3️⃣ Convert to Mid-Fidelity Wireframes
- Use **Figma** to create **black & white wireframes**.
- Include **main elements only**, no styles or micro-interactions.
- Keep screens **clear, simple, and structured**.
